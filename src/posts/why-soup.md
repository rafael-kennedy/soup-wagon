Soup is magic. The alchemy of the soup pot transforms prosaic ingredients into something that is always more than the sum of its parts. Start with a redolent mirepoix, fragrant stock, silky beans, jewel like vegetable pieces, chewy noodles, a soup engages all your senses. Tantalizing, warming, above all nutritious, soup is the ultimate comfort food. It is easy to store, reheats well, meals ready when you are.
