Soup is magic. The caldron produces something that is always more than the sum of its parts. Start with a redolent mirepoix or silken beans, add a fragrant broth, jewel colored pieces of vegetable, chewy noodles, rich cheeses, thick cream, transforming them into soup brings each element into a whole. Tantalizing, warming, relaxing; but most of all nourishing.

Easy to store, quick to reheat, soup is the perfect meal.
