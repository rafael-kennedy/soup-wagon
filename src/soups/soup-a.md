Well, yes, it's timely. Everybody thinks of pumpkins at this time of year. But it isn't cliche, don't get sniffy about this nourishing vegetable just because it's photogenic. It's high in betacarotene to boost your immune system and fight aging; and heart healthy potassium and fiber. 

This soup pairs the pumpkin with warming spices, ginger and creamy coconut milk. 

It is warm and soothing, or if this heat wave holds, can even be eaten chilled.
