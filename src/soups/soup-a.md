Well, yes, it's timely, maybe a bit cliche. Everybody thinks of pumpkins at this time of year. But don't get sniffy about this nourishing vegetable just because it's photogenic. It's high in beta carotene to boost your immune system and fight aging; and has lots of heart healthy potassium and fiber. 

This soup pairs the pumpkin with tofu for protein. and warming spices, ginger and creamy coconut milk, \
It is smooth and rich; warm and soothing. And, if this heat wave holds it can even be eaten chilled.

Allergens: Soy, Tree nuts (coconuts)

Cost 10/quart plus package.
