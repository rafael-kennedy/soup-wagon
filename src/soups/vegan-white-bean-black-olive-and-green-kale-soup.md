Kind of a Tuscan inspired soup, I think, though I've never been to Tuscany. Having Olive oil, olives and rosemary makes it Tuscan, don't you think? Anyway, this soup is rich tasting and hearty. Meat eaters won't notice the lack of meat. The kale isn't decoration, there is enough to give a nutritional punch. Eat it with Crusty bread and think sunny thoughts.
