I used this image, because this is the very kale that is in this soup. And isn't it beautiful? Organically grown here in the neighbourhood. I could have taken a picture of a boul of soup, I suppose, but it would have looked like a lot of other bowls of soup. This particular soup is  kind of a Tuscan inspired, I think, though I've never been to Tuscany. Having Olive oil, olives and rosemary makes it Tuscan, don't you think? Anyway, this soup is rich tasting and hearty. Meat eaters won't notice the lack of meat. The kale isn't decoration, there is enough to give a nutritional punch. Eat it with Crusty bread and think sunny thoughts.
