This is the soup your grandmother would have made for you*, if she had the time to make soup from scratch. It is nourishing and science suggests that it can help fight colds and flu.  Its base is a slow simmered homemade chicken broth made from locally grown chickens, and loaded with vegetables and hand cut noodles. The soup is lightly flavored with herbs, but not so much as to cover up that fresh broth. The amount of garlic is generous, to add garlic's antiviral properties to that of the chicken, but the garlic flavor cooks into the background and isn't prominent. The noodles the the best part of this soup (besides the broth, of course) homemade noodles are a bit heftier and chewier than store bought, and you can freeze this soup without the noodles turning to mush. It might make sense to buy a couple of extra jars of this soup to keep on hand--since it's still 2020 for a few more weeks.

\* ok, there are a lot of different gandmothers in Lexington and they make all kinds of chicken soup. We'll revisit some other versions other weeks.
