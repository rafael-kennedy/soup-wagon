My parents live in New Mexico. Whenever I went home from college (a long time ago) I would beg my mother to take me to a certain cafe in Santa Fe. I don't remember what it was called, or where it was. (near the plaza in old town somewhere...) But I will never forget their potato soup, which I loved. This is my attempt at recreating it. It is maybe born of the hippie/arts subculture of Santa Fe, rather than the  traditional New Mexican one. I've made it for the co-op hot bar many times and it is popular with the customers there.
