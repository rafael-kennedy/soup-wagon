Lionhead Meatball Soup

 Wonderful, big tender beef and pork meatballs braised in cabbage, and served with vegetables and greens in a fragrant chicken broth. 

Do you love noodles? You can cheat and serve this soup over a package of ramen noodles (prepared without the terrible flavor packet) But don't tell any of the adults around you.
