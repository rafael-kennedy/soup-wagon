Chinese Wedding Meatball Soup

Chinese people do not serve this soup at their weddings. If there is a soup like this in China, I don't know about it. It's a marriage of Italian wedding soup, (which I love--tiny meatballs with escarole and sometimes ditalinni) and chinese meatballs. Wonderful, tender beef and pork meatballs braised in cabbage, and served with vegetables and greens in a fragrant chicken broth. 

Do you love noodles? You can cheat and serve this soup over a package of ramen noodles (prepared without the terrible flavor packet) But don't tell any of the adults around you.
