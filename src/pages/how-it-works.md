Once a week I'll make two pots of soup, one vegan and one with animal products--either dairy, meat or fish.

Each handcrafted pot will be about 5 gallons and when it's gone, it's gone.  

I'll post a description of each soup on the website.

 If you live in Kenwick or Mentelle Neighbourhoods, you can order quarts of soup online, pay for it by paypal, and I'll deliver chilled soup to your porch Wednesday afternoon. Leave a small cooler if you won't be home.

  I'll heat up any soup that hasn't been accounted for in orders, and set up the soupwagon in a public place between 5 and 6:30, and you can stop by and buy some fresh hot soup. I'll announce the location on the website and twitter. If there is soup left after that, it'll be donated to the homeless.
