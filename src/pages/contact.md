My contact info:

Hi! My name is Beth Rosdatter.

I've been cooking professionally for 5 years, but have been interested and involved in nutrition and environmental issues for a lot longer. (this is a picture of me chopping endless onions when I was volunteering for United World Kitchen in Tijuana MX)
