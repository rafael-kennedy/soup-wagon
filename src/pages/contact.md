Wednesday is soup day.\
\
Each week I make two pots of soup, one vegan and one with animal products. (meat, fish and/or dairy)

Each handcrafted pot will be about 5 gallons and when it's gone, it's gone.  

I'll post a description of each soup on the website and my facebook page.

 If you live in Kenwick or Mentelle Neighborhoods, you can order quarts of soup online, pay by paypal, and I'll deliver chilled soup to your porch Wednesday afternoon. Leave a small cooler if you won't be home. Please do not order delivered soup if you do not live in the neighborhood.

 I'll heat up any soup that hasn't been accounted for in orders, and set up the Soup Wagon in a public place between 5 and 6:30, and you can stop by and buy some fresh hot soup. I'll announce the location on the website and twitter. If there is soup left after 6:30, it'll be donated to the homeless.

I'm aiming for a no waste business. There is an added cost for soup in plastic containers (1.00). You can pay a one time fee (3.00 each) for returnable glass jars, and return them when you get your next order. You can also bring your own container to the hot Soup Wagon and have it filled for no added package fee.
