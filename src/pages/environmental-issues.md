I am committed to reducing my carbon footprint and preserving the environment to the extent I can, and part of this commitment includes reducing the amount of waste (especially plastic waste) I produce, and buying things that haven't been shipped very far. I am sourcing ingredients locally when I can, some from my own garden, some from local farms. I use organic ingredients when I can as well, but would rather choose local if there's a choice.  If you have questions about a particular ingredient, get in touch and I'll tell you what I know about its origins.
