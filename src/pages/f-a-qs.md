### Q: This is so complicated! I just want some soup!

Here are answers to some of the questions you may have. If you have any others drop me an e-mail or text.

### Q: I don't understand how the prices are listed. What's this about a "base price?"

To reduce the amount of packaging that gets thrown away as a result of my soup, I'm listing a base price just for the soup. but of course, you can't carry your soup home in your hands. You need somekind of container. If you are coming to the pop-up soupwagon, you can bring a bowl or container (that holds the amount of soup you want to buy) and only pay the base price. Otherwise,  you can also pay for a plastic to-go container or pay a deposit and get a great returnable glass canning jar. When you return the (rinsed) jar you can get your money back or trade for newly sterilized, filled jars.

### Q: What about tax?

A: I calculated the tax into the price of the soup. It's just simpler. Think of it as a 6% off coupon. :-)

### Q: Can I return the plastic container?

A: I can't boil the plastic containers to sterilize them, so I can't accept them as returns.

### Q: I'd like to get some soup delivered, but I won't be home.

A: leave a small cooler and ice pack on your porch and I'll drop the soup in the cooler.

### Q: What if I don't live in the right neighborhood?

A: I only deliver within a small geographical area, so I can get deliveries done in a reasonable amount of time. You could come to the pop-up soupwagon.

### Q: How many people will a quart of soup feed?

A: If it is a first course or light lunch, figure one quart for four people. If it is the main part of a meal, figure  one quart will feed two. My soups are created with nutrition in mind and are hearty.

### Q: How long can I keep my soup?

To a large extent that depends on your refrigerator. But assume at least 5 days, and most of the soups can be frozen. 

### Q: I really liked the soup I got last week. Can I get some more of that?

A: No, all of the soups are "limited edition." Once the batch is gone, it's gone. I could return the most popular soups to the rotation, though. Leave me a review of the one you liked with and contact info (this will not be public) and I'll notify you when I make it again.
