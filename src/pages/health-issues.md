The soup is all prepared in a health department inspected commercial kitchen using all the care possible to make sure it is healthy and free of infection. I have a food handler's permit, and have been cooking commercially for 5 years. Care is taken when delivering soup to make sure it stays cold or hot.

You should be able to keep your quart of soup in the refrigerator for at least 5 days, maybe more. This is hard to predict as everyone's refridgerator is a bit different. Food is safest if held below 40 deg. farenheit.

Most of the soups will freeze well. If you are freezing in a glass jar it is best to take the lid off the jar until the soup is frozen and then replace it which will help safeguard against breaking. Do not take the jar directly from the freezer to microwave. 

All ingredients are listed in the description of each soup. I highlight common allergens.
