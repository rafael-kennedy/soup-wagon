### Preparation and storage:

The soup is prepared in a health department inspected commercial kitchen using all the care possible to make sure it is healthy and free of infection. I have a food handler's permit, and have been cooking commercially for 5 years. Care is taken when delivering soup to make sure it stays cold or hot.

You should be able to keep your quart of soup in the refrigerator for at least 5 days, maybe more. This is hard to predict as everyone's refrigerator is a bit different. Food keeps best below 40 deg. farenheit.

Most of the soups will freeze well. If you are freezing in a glass jar it is best to take the lid off the jar until the soup is frozen and then replace it, which will help safeguard against breaking. It is also a good idea to eat a few spoonfuls from the top of the container to give the soup room to expand. Do not take a glass directly from the freezer to microwave, thaw  in the refrigerator first. 

### Allergens:

All ingredients are listed in the description of each soup. I highlight common allergens. 

Though every care is taken to keep from cross contamination, the soup is made in a kitchen that processes all kinds of foods, so if you have a severe allergy, better safe than sorry.

### Organic ingredients:

I try to use the freshest, most nutrient rich-ingredients I can when available, this is often organically grown vegetables. It can also be local food from farms that have not been certified as organic, which I would choose over organic foods that have been shipped. Sometimes neither is available, (or available for a manageable price).  If you have a question about an ingredient in any particular soup, contact me and I'll tell you what I know about its origins.
